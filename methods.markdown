# Hybrid dropdown object methods.

Once a hybrid dropdown object has been initialised,

```
a reference to the object is placed on the node structure of the element on which the dropdown is constructed,



| method           | description                                                  |
|:-----------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------|      
| `refresh({})`| used to refresh a dropdown field, destroys the option list and reconstructs it.  The method can have configuration options passed in order to modify the dropdown.  This is especially useful to filter the option list by passing a new filter function.|
