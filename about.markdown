This is inspired by an original [idea](https://css-tricks.com/striking-a-balance-between-native-and-custom-select-elements/) by Sandrina Pereira (@sandrina-p). This plugin is written in pure JavaScript and has evolved considerably from the initial idea.

The code for this plugin is inspired from [@pickykneee](https://github.com/NickPiscitelli) excellent JavaScript slider plugin [Glider.js](https://github.com/NickPiscitelli/Glider.js)
